.. _pyb.UART:

class UART -- duplex serial communication bus
=============================================

UART implements the standard UART/USART duplex serial communications protocol.  At
the physical level it consists of 2 lines: RX and TX.  The unit of communication
is a character (not to be confused with a string character) which can be 8 or 9
bits wide.

UART objects can be created and initialised using::

    from pyb import UART

    uart = UART(1, 9600)                         # init with given baudrate
    uart.init(9600, bits=8, parity=None, stop=1) # init with given parameters

.. only:: port_pyboard

    Bits can be 7, 8 or 9.  Parity can be None, 0 (even) or 1 (odd).  Stop can be 1 or 2.
    
    *Note:* with parity=None, only 8 and 9 bits are supported.  With parity enabled,
    only 7 and 8 bits are supported.

.. only:: port_wipy

    Bits can be 5, 6, 7, 8.  Parity can be None, 0 (even) or 1 (odd).  Stop can be 1 or 2.


A UART object acts like a stream object and reading and writing is done
using the standard stream methods::

    uart.read(10)       # read 10 characters, returns a bytes object
    uart.readall()      # read all available characters
    uart.readline()     # read a line
    uart.readinto(buf)  # read and store into the given buffer
    uart.write('abc')   # write the 3 characters

Individual characters can be read/written using::

    uart.readchar()     # read 1 character and returns it as an integer
    uart.writechar(42)  # write 1 character

To check if there is anything to be read, use::

    uart.any()               # returns True if any characters waiting

*Note:* The stream functions ``read``, ``write``, etc. are new in MicroPython v1.3.4.
Earlier versions use ``uart.send`` and ``uart.recv``.

Constructors
------------

.. only:: port_pyboard

    .. class:: pyb.UART(bus, ...)
    
       Construct a UART object on the given bus.  ``bus`` can be 1-6, or 'XA', 'XB', 'YA', or 'YB'.
       With no additional parameters, the UART object is created but not
       initialised (it has the settings from the last initialisation of
       the bus, if any).  If extra arguments are given, the bus is initialised.
       See ``init`` for parameters of initialisation.
    
       The physical pins of the UART busses are:
    
         - ``UART(4)`` is on ``XA``: ``(TX, RX) = (X1, X2) = (PA0, PA1)``
         - ``UART(1)`` is on ``XB``: ``(TX, RX) = (X9, X10) = (PB6, PB7)``
         - ``UART(6)`` is on ``YA``: ``(TX, RX) = (Y1, Y2) = (PC6, PC7)``
         - ``UART(3)`` is on ``YB``: ``(TX, RX) = (Y9, Y10) = (PB10, PB11)``
         - ``UART(2)`` is on: ``(TX, RX) = (X3, X4) = (PA2, PA3)``

.. only:: port_wipy

    .. class:: pyb.UART(bus, ...)
    
       Construct a UART object on the given bus.  ``bus`` can be 1 or 2.
       With no additional parameters, the UART object is created but not
       initialised (it has the settings from the last initialisation of
       the bus, if any).  If extra arguments are given, the bus is initialised.
       See ``init`` for parameters of initialisation.

Methods
-------

.. only:: port_pyboard

    .. method:: uart.init(baudrate, bits=8, parity=None, stop=1, \*, timeout=1000, flow=None, timeout_char=0, read_buf_len=64)
    
       Initialise the UART bus with the given parameters:
    
         - ``baudrate`` is the clock rate.
         - ``bits`` is the number of bits per character, 7, 8 or 9.
         - ``parity`` is the parity, ``None``, 0 (even) or 1 (odd).
         - ``stop`` is the number of stop bits, 1 or 2.
         - ``flow`` sets the flow control type. Can be None, ``UART.RTS``, ``UART.CTS``
           or ``UART.RTS | UART.CTS``.
         - ``timeout`` is the timeout in milliseconds to wait for the first character.
         - ``timeout_char`` is the timeout in milliseconds to wait between characters.
         - ``read_buf_len`` is the character length of the read buffer (0 to disable).
    
       This method will raise an exception if the baudrate could not be set within
       5% of the desired value.  The minimum baudrate is dictated by the frequency
       of the bus that the UART is on; UART(1) and UART(6) are APB2, the rest are on
       APB1.  The default bus frequencies give a minimum baudrate of 1300 for
       UART(1) and UART(6) and 650 for the others.  Use :func:`pyb.freq <pyb.freq>`
       to reduce the bus frequencies to get lower baudrates.
    
       *Note:* with parity=None, only 8 and 9 bits are supported.  With parity enabled,
       only 7 and 8 bits are supported.

.. only:: port_wipy

    .. method:: uart.init(baudrate, bits=8, parity=None, stop=1, \*, timeout=1000, flow=None, timeout_char=0)
    
       Initialise the UART bus with the given parameters:
    
         - ``baudrate`` is the clock rate.
         - ``bits`` is the number of bits per character, 7, 8 or 9.
         - ``parity`` is the parity, ``None``, 0 (even) or 1 (odd).
         - ``stop`` is the number of stop bits, 1 or 2.
         - ``flow`` sets the flow control type. Can be None, ``UART.RTS``, ``UART.CTS``
           or ``UART.RTS | UART.CTS``.
         - ``timeout`` is the timeout in milliseconds to wait for the first character.
         - ``timeout_char`` is the timeout in milliseconds to wait between characters.

.. method:: uart.deinit()

   Turn off the UART bus.

.. method:: uart.any()

   Return ``True`` if any characters waiting, else ``False``.

.. method:: uart.read([nbytes])

   Read characters.  If ``nbytes`` is specified then read at most that many bytes.

   .. only:: port_pyboard

      *Note:* for 9 bit characters each character takes two bytes, ``nbytes`` must
      be even, and the number of characters is ``nbytes/2``.

      Return value: a bytes object containing the bytes read in.  Returns ``b''``
      on timeout.

   .. only:: port_wipy
    
      Return value: a bytes object containing the bytes read in.  Returns ``b''``
      on timeout.

.. method:: uart.readall()

   Read as much data as possible.

   Return value: a bytes object.

.. method:: uart.readchar()

   Receive a single character on the bus.

   Return value: The character read, as an integer.  Returns -1 on timeout.

.. method:: uart.readinto(buf[, nbytes])

   Read bytes into the ``buf``.  If ``nbytes`` is specified then read at most
   that many bytes.  Otherwise, read at most ``len(buf)`` bytes.

   Return value: number of bytes read and stored into ``buf``.

.. method:: uart.readline()

   Read a line, ending in a newline character.

   Return value: the line read.

.. method:: uart.write(buf)

   .. only:: port_pyboard

      Write the buffer of bytes to the bus.  If characters are 7 or 8 bits wide
      then each byte is one character.  If characters are 9 bits wide then two
      bytes are used for each character (little endian), and ``buf`` must contain
      an even number of bytes.

      Return value: number of bytes written.

   .. only:: port_wipy

      Write the buffer of bytes to the bus.

      Return value: number of bytes written.

.. method:: uart.writechar(char)

   Write a single character on the bus.  ``char`` is an integer to write.
   Return value: ``None``.

.. method:: uart.sendbreak()

   Send a break condition on the bus.  This drives the bus low for a duration
   of 13 bits.
   Return value: ``None``.

.. only:: port_wipy

    .. method:: uart.callback(value, priority=1, handler=None)

       Create a callback to be triggered when data is received on the UART.

           - ``value`` sets the size in bytes of the Rx buffer. Every character
             received is put into this buffer as long as there's space free.
           - ``priority`` level of the interrupt. Can take values in the range 1-7.
             Higher values represent higher priorities.
           - ``handler`` an optional function to be called when new characters arrive.

       .. note::

          The handler will be called whenever any of the following two conditions are met:
          
              - 4 new characters have been received.
              - At least 1 new character is waiting in the Rx buffer and the Rx line has been
                silent for the duration of 1 complete frame.

          This means that when the handler function is called there might be 1, 2, 3 or 4
          characters waiting.

       Return a callback object.
